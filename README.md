# Quantitative-trading-strategy-via-stock-clustering
This project builds a dynamic trading strategy by clustering S&amp;P 500 stocks based on technical features. Each month, similar assets are grouped using K-Means, and optimal portfolios are constructed via Efficient Frontier (max Sharpe ratio). The strategy’s performance is visualized and compared against the S&amp;P 500 benchmark.
